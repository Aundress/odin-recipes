        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p id="description">Turducken brings three birds into one dish, turkey, duck, and chicken.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 small chicken (3 1/2 to 4 pounds pre-boning</li>
            <li>2 pounds raw bulk sausage meat</li>
            <li>1 duck (4 to 4 /12 pounds pre-boning</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 turkey (10 to 13 pounds), carcass removed, leg and wing bones left intact</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Season chicken evenly on all sides with salt and pepper. Lay chicken flat, skin side down, on cutting board. 
                Shape 12 ounces of sausage into a log roughly 2 inches in diameter and place in the center of
                 the chicken. Lift one side of chicken and wrap tightly around sausage. 
                 Lift the other side, allowing the skin from both sides to overlap and form a seal. 
                 The chicken should now be wrapped around the sausage. Wrap tightly in several layers of plastic wrap so that
                  chicken forms a tight cylinder (see note). Alternatively, chicken can be tightly trussed with butcher's twine.
            </li>
            <li>Place chicken inside a vacuum sealer bag and seal. Place in a large stockpot and cover with warm water. 
                Place over medium-high heat and heat until bubbles just begin to rise from the bottom. Reduce heat to lowest 
                setting and cook until chicken feels firm to the touch and an instant read thermometer inserted through the 
                plastic into the center of the chicken registers 140 to 145째F, about 45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                While chicken is cooking, season the duck on all sides with salt and pepper. Place a 36- by 12-inch piece of 
                plastic wrap on the cutting board. Lay duck flat, skin side down, on plastic wrap. Spread remaining sausage 
                evenly over surface of meat. When chicken is cooked, remove from bag and plastic wrap and carefully pat dry 
                with paper towels. Place hot chicken directly on top of duck, aligned along the center. Using the plastic wrap 
                to aid you, carefully shape the duck around the chicken. Roll into a tight cylinder in several layers of plastic 
                wrap. Alternatively, duck can be tightly trussed with butcher's twine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place chicken/duck inside a vacuum sealer bag and seal. Place in a large stockpot and cover with warm water. Place 
                over medium-high heat and heat until bubbles just begin to rise from the bottom. Reduce heat to lowest setting and 
                cook until Duck feels firm to the touch, about 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove duck from water. If you used a vacuum bag or plastic wrap, remove both, then tightly truss the duck with twine.
                 Dry exterior thoroughly with paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add duck/chicken and cook, turning 
                occasionally, until well browned and crisp on all sides, pouring off excess rendered fat as necessary (you can reserve 
                this fat for another use), about 15 minutes total.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 425째F. Place turkey skin-side-down on a cutting board and season 
                exposed surface with salt and pepper. Remove twine from duck/chicken and place in the center of the turkey, aligned along 
                the center. If necessary, trim duck/chicken roll so that is is the same length as the turkey breasts. (You can serve the 
                excess duck/turkey as well).
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully lift one side of the turkey to cover the duck/chicken, then lift the other side, letting the skin overlap by at 
                least 1 inch. Use metal or wooden skewers to secure the skin in 5 to 8 locations. Carefully transfer turkey to a V- or U-rack 
                set in a roasting pan, seam-side down.
            </li>

                Carefully lift one side of the turkey to cover the duck/chicken, then lift the other side, letting the skin overlap by at least 
                1 inch. Use metal or wooden skewers to secure the skin in 5 to 8 locations. Carefully transfer turkey to a V- or U-rack set in a 
                roasting pan, seam-side down.
            </li>
            <li>
                With the turkey's legs facing you, place a long piece of butcher's twine behind the breasts, tucking it into the wing joints. Pull 
                it around the breast along its base to the bottom of the breast, then allow the ends to cross over. Wrap each end around the end of 
                the drumstick, and pull them tightly together. Loop the ends of the twine around both drumsticks a few times to secure, then tie a 
                knot and trim the excess. Rub remaining oil all over turkey and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to oven and roast until golden 
                brown, turkey breast meat registers at least 150째F on an instant read thermometer, and thighs registers at least 165째F, about 1 1/2 hours.

            <li>
                Transfer to cutting board, carefully remove skewers, and allow to rest for 20 minutes. To carve, remove legs and wings. Split breast in half 
                lengthwise down the center to create two boneless halves. Slice crosswise into serving slices.
