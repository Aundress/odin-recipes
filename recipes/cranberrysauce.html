        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Bring the sauce to the talk of the table with this delicous cranberry sauce!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup light brown sugar, tightly packed</li>
            <li>1/3 cup water</li>
            <li>2/3 cup orange juice</li>
            <li>12 oz cranberries, rinsed and picked through, bad/bruised cranberries removed</li>  
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine sugars, water, and orange juice in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat.  
                Stir occasionally until sugars are dissolved, and bring to a boil.  
                ⅔ cup (133 g) sugar, ⅓ cup (67 g) light brown sugar, tightly packed, ⅓ cup (78 ml) water, 
                ⅔ cup (157 ml) orange juice
            </li>
            <li>
                Add cranberries and return to a boil.
                12  oz (340 g) cranberries
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce heat to a simmer and continue to cook cranberries, stirring occasionally, 
                10-15 minutes or until all or most berries have burst (careful, there is some splatter) 
                and the mixture is slightly reduced. The longer you cook your cranberries the thicker your 
                mixture will be, but it will also thicken up after standing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer mixture to a bowl and allow it to cool for at least 20 minutes at room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
